#What SED editor can do
##SED is used in two ways
## It only edits the file
## It only edits the output
## -e is used, so that we can use multiple operations in the same SED line (sed -i -e '5d' -e '/nologin/ d' passwd)

Lines
1.Delete some lines
 - Delete based on line number = sed -e '1d' /etc/passwd/ It only edits the output and provide the output
   or sed -i -e '5d' passwd It only edits the file and no output will be provided (using CAT command we should view the file)
 (Will not provide the out put)
 - Delete based on strings = sed -i -e '/nologin/ d' passwd
2.Add some lines
 - Add based on line number = sed -i -e '1 a Hello' -e '/mangod/ a Hello World' passwd
3.Modify(Change) some lines
 - Change a line = sed -i -e '2 c Hello Universe' -e '/centos/ c Hello Galixy' passwd

Words
1.Delete some words
 - sed -i -e 's|bin||g' passwd
## | represents boundries, you can also boundries with (/,?,:,;,#,@)

2.Modify(Substitute) some words
- sed -i -e 's|bin|BIN|' passwd in this command in a line if there are two bin, it will replace only one bin to BIN
- sed -i -e 's|bin|BIN|g' passwd in this command in a line if there are two bin, it will replace both the bin to BIN
## g will replace all the instances of bin
- sed -i -e 's|bin|BIN|2' passwd
## any give number instead of 'g' it will delete the exact number of instance
