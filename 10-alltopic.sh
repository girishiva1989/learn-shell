#1. How to write shell script files and run it
# File ending with .sh, is what we prefer to use to write script, so it is understood it is a shell script, but for OS it does not matter
# There are multiple ways to run a script, one way is using "Bash scriptname.sh"

#2. Printing
# Echo word
# Word will be printed
# We can print colo
# We Can print multiple lines = echo -e "Line1\nLine2\Line3"
# We an print tab = echo -e "Line\tLine2"

#3. Variables
# Refer Variables.sh
# Properties of variables
#Read write
b=10
b=20
# Here b was declared with 10 and again b is declared with 20
# When we access b = echo $b, we will get output as 20, so this is the default property
# But some times if we need to mark a variable as readonly after declaring, then readonly command will help
#readonly b
#b=30
# b will not be assigned with 30, we an see only previous value if we echo b.
# Local Variables
# Variables declared in this script, can be accessed within this script only, because the default property is local
# Variables declared in CLI, cannot be accessed in script
c=30
echo c - $c
# Declare a variable in CLI c=10, try to echo $c, but try to run the script having echo $c, we will not able to access the value
# If we want access the variable, which is declared in CLI, we should convert the variable from local to  environment variable
# In the CLI, type export c, and then run the script with echo $c, then we can see value 10

#4. Inputs
# Refer Variables.sh
# Script has it's own input, and function has it own input

#5. Conditions
#Refer if.sh
# If uses expressions
# string expressions
# Number expressions
# File expressions
# Case command - it can do only string comparision

#6. Loops
# IF we want to execute same command again and again, then loops will be used
#Expression based loop
#Input based loop

#7. Functions
# Refer function.sh
#IF we declare a name to a set of commands is called as function
# Variables inside main program can be accessed and modified inside a function
# Function has its own exit status

#8. Exit Status
# Refer exitstatus.sh

#9. Quotes
#if there is any special character in input to the command then we use quotes
# Single quote - to print as it is we use single quotes (does not allow variables)
# Double quote - to print along with variable substitution ( Allow variables)
